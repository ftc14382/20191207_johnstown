We participated in: Q2, Q7, Q17, Q21, and Q27. I was not able to
get into position to make a video of Q21. The robot and the kids performed
beyond any expectations. We won every match we played and were the 
winning alliance captain.

## Q21

## Q27
** 5/5 Points ** We did not detecte a Skystone and we ran into our alliance partner. We managed to navigate.

## SF2-1
** 5/30 Points ** We tried and failed to move the foundation. We navigated.

## F-1
** 5/30 Points ** We simply parked to avoid the possibility of interfering with our partner (Apollo Robotics) that had a very reliable 25 point autonmous.
